## Step 1: Self-Assessment

Ask yourself:
- What are my current skills?
- What do I want to achieve in the next 6–12 months?
- What are the gaps in my knowledge?

Based on the SWOT analysis, I identified areas of improvement in **cloud computing**, **embedded systems**, and **communication skills**.
